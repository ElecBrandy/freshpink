On this page, we'll introduce you to the various features that **FreshPink** supports for pages. This theme describes the Wide Image Area, Progress-bar, GitHub Chart, and Back to Top Button.

<br>
<br>

> Wide Image Area

This theme provides Wide Image Area functionality. You can insert any Wide Image Area of your choice at the top of the `.md` file following the toml form: `featured_image = " "`. By default, `basic.png` from the static folder is set, but you can customize it with any image link or address of your choice. If you don't specify any image, you'll see a gray gradient. Try inserting a nice image that represents your article.

> Progress-bar

Enhance the reading experience on your blog with a progress bar for each post. This feature provides a visual cue to your readers, indicating how much of the article they've read and how much more is left.

<br>
<br>

> Github Chart

With integration using [**GitHub Chart**](https://github.com/akerl/githubchart), FreshPink allows you to showcase your GitHub activity directly on your blog's homepage. This feature lets your readers see your GitHub contributions at a glance, highlighting your development efforts.
<br>
If you want to replace this chart with your own logs, add [params] to your `config.toml` file `githubUsername = "username"` with your GitHub username.

<br>
<br>

> Back to Top Button

A "Back to Top" button, implemented via [**Vanilla Back to Top**](https://github.com/vfeskov/vanilla-back-to-top), enhances navigation on your blog. This convenience feature makes it easy for readers to return to the top of the page, improving the overall user experience.
