> How to Install

## Method 1: Install as a Git Submodule

### 1. Navigate to Your Hugo Site Directory
Open a terminal and change directory to your Hugo site root. If you haven't created a Hugo site yet, run `hugo new site yourSiteName` to create one.
<br>

### 2. Add Theme as a Git Submodule
Add the FreshPink theme to your site as a Git submodule by running the following command:

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:ElecBrandy/freshpink.git themes/freshpink
```
<br>

### 3. Update Site Configuration
   Open your site's `config.toml` file in a text editor and update the `theme` variable to `"freshpink"`:
   ```toml
   theme = "freshpink"
   ```
<br>

### 4. Preview Your Site
   Run your site locally to see the theme in action:
   ```bash
   hugo server
   ```
<br>

## Method 2: Download and Install Manually

### 1. Download the Theme
   Go to the [FreshPink GitHub repository](https://github.com/ElecBrandy/freshpink) and download the theme as a ZIP file.
<br>

### 2. Extract and Move the Theme
   Extract the ZIP file and move the extracted folder to the `themes` directory of your Hugo site.
<br>

### 3. Update Site Configuration
   Just like in the Git Submodule method, open your `config.toml` file and set the `theme` variable to `"freshpink"`.
<br>

### 4. Preview Your Site
   Use the `hugo server` command to build and preview your site locally.
